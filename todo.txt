- automatic up/down casting with size_of / constant integers
   So size_of should NOT return the smallest integer type that can hold the value,
   because when doing  a: size_of(int), a should get the type 'uint', and not 'u8'.
   The feature we want instead is automatic casting of constants

- break, continue
- make .slice[] not necessary for Arrays
- bring back TB
- anonymous struct and array literals?
- automatic slicing for array types? i.e. make this possible: []string({"hi", "bye"})

- OpenGL + Win32
- keyboard / mouse input
- Goal #1: Basic 2D drawing library + demo app for it

- Goal #2: 3D chess game with OpenGL with no third-party dependencies, except
- cgltf, miniaudio, stbi, stbtt
- this game should include cool PBR graphics and sounds

- towards a 3D level editor / engine!!

- Example programs ideas:
- Ray tracer demo program
- Game of life
- Chess game, maybe even 3d? That would be pretty cool!
- tetris? breakout? pong? snake?
