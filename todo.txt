[] get raylib up and running
[] implicit dereferencing of array subscript[]

- keyboard / mouse input
[] HMM-like math library with stuff like sqrt and vectors to start with until we implement array math
[] stbi
[] stbtt

- Goal #1: Basic 2D drawing library + demo app for it

[] @module_struct
[] struct and array ==, != comparison

[] slice bounds checking
	hmm, maybe this could be implemented similar to enabling libc where it's an optional tag that the Basic module implements

--------------- Keith release candidate ---------------
[] optionals
[] hash procedure type based on its contents, not its unique node
[] break, continue, to_else, named scopes
[] module ' declaration

- Goal #2: 3D chess game with OpenGL with no third-party dependencies, except
- cgltf, miniaudio, stbi, stbtt
- this game should include cool PBR graphics and sounds
	vxgi would be awesome. Could we make a game in sponza?

- towards a 3D level editor / engine!!

- Example programs ideas:
- Ray tracer demo program
- Game of life
- Chess game, maybe even 3d? That would be pretty cool!
- 2D physics simulation
- tetris? breakout? pong? snake?

Future:
- caching modules into object files / only rebuilding when the files have changed. For detecting if files have changed,
  we should use the file modtime.
