- debug info on globals
- break, continue
- automatic slicing for array types? i.e. make this possible: []string({"hi", "bye"})
- initializers
- make .slice[] not necessary for Arrays
- anonymous struct and array literals?

- OpenGL + Win32
- keyboard / mouse input
- Goal #1: Basic 2D drawing library + demo app for it

- Goal #2: 3D chess game with OpenGL with no third-party dependencies, except
- cgltf, miniaudio, stbi, stbtt
- this game should include cool PBR graphics and sounds

- towards a 3D level editor / engine!!

- Example programs ideas:
- Ray tracer demo program
- Game of life
- Chess game, maybe even 3d? That would be pretty cool!
- 2D physics simulation
- tetris? breakout? pong? snake?

Future:
- caching modules into object files / only rebuilding when the files have changed. For detecting if files have changed,
  we should use the file modtime.
