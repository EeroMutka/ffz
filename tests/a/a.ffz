// so I guess the program could return 0 when it succeeds and 1 when it fails,
// and the test framework would just look at which programs return 0 and don't crash.

// other idea would be to print stuff and have a "ground truth" stdout string to compare to.
// But idk if that's necessary. Maybe.

// The test-runner should totally use FFZ as a library!
// Maybe we could even create a custom definition for `ground_truth` from the test runner like:

#ground_truth: struct{text: string}

$ground_truth{"
asdf
901 25
"}

#main: proc() => u32 {
	ret 0
}
