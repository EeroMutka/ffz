// A type is a POD-type if it's a basic type or struct containing basic types. Fixed types can be compared.
// An array, string, or slice can be compared if the element type is a POD-type.
// hmm... what about float comparisons? -0 and 0 are equal, but they're not bitwise equal.
// so we can't use memcmp for optimization.
// let's just not allow struct comparison for now I guess.
