// data-breakpoints are amazing.
// The only annoying thing is, they don't work with data structures that realloc, i.e. a dynamic array.
// dynamic arrays still have their place, we can't just replace them with (exponential) bucket arrays.
// so maybe we could make it possible to inform the debugger about realloc?

// i.e.
/*
#realloc: proc(...) {
	Debugger.info_memory_was_moved(from, to, size)
}
