!!! WIP, not inteded to be used yet !!!

Home for FFZ programming language.

# How to build:

In the future this should be simpler, but for now:

1. Make sure you have visual studio 2022 installed (older should probably work too)
2. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/eeromutka/ffz`
3. go to `Cuik/tb/` and build Tilde Backend by running `python build.py x64`
4. Download premake5 from https://premake.github.io/download and run `premake vs2022` in the repository root
5. open `build/ffz.sln` and compile!
